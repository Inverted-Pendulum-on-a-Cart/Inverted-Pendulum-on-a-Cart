# Inverted-Pendulum-on-a-Cart

The primary objective of this project is to establish a thorough understanding of dynamics and control of a system. This project comprises of balancing an inverted pendulum on a cart, the premise being — use a simple yet classical control problem that provides an in depth and comprehensive working of the mechanics involved in building a single degree of freedom controller. Here we have analysed the system using various tools to determine the stability, sensitivity, phase and gain margins. The system was modelled using Simulink and Simscape. We used several controllers to draw out the distinctions in their results and this includes — PID and LQR. Validation with a physical model is in process.
